# Lindenmayer Systems - University Project (JAVA)

This project is an L-System (Lindenmayer System) interpreter developed as a university project during my second year of studies at the University of Caen. L-Systems are formal systems used to model plant growth, create fractals, and generate algorithmic patterns. This interpreter takes user-defined L-System rules and axioms, generating the resulting character sequence for a given number of iterations, which can then be visualized graphically.

## Introduction to L-Systems

**L-Systems** were developed by Hungarian biologist Lindenmayer to describe the growth of biological forms, like algae or ferns. An L-System consists of:
- **Axiom**: An initial string of characters.
- **Production Rules**: A set of rewrite rules defining how each symbol in the string is transformed from one iteration to the next.
- **Rotation Angle**: Used for graphical visualization with defined angles at each iteration.

L-Systems are commonly used for generating fractals and simulating biological structures.

## Features

- **L-System Interpretation**: Supports user-defined rules and axioms to generate L-System sequences.
- **Graphical Visualization**: Uses Java's graphical capabilities to visualize the generated L-System patterns.
- **Customization**: Users can define rules, axiom, rotation angle, and number of iterations.

## Example

Here is a simple example of an L-System representing a 3D flower:
